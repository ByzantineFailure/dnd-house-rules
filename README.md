# dnd-house-rules
House rules for DnD games I run.

All rules herein should not be considered set in stone.  This repository is a living document which will be adjusted for balance and fun as games are played with the rules contained within it.

Most of these rules are cribbed from other games I've been in and all credit goes to DMs who initially created them.  Some of these rules have been tweaked to suit my tastes.
