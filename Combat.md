# Combat

## Flanking

We will play with a variant of the "Flanking" rule.  Generally speaking, anywhere "behind" a creature will suffice to flank it.
|EXAMPLE | GRID | HERE |
|-|-|-|
| EMPTY | ATTACKER | EMPTY |
| EMPTY | TARGET | EMPTY |
| FLANKS | FLANKS | FLANKS |

"Flanked" is a condition which gives all attacks on a creature advantage.

## Attacks of Opportunity

Generally speaking, Attacks of Opportunity remain the same as in the PHB with one exception:

**If you are moving from one side of a creature to another while remaining within its threatened radius you will provoke an attack of opportunity.**

_Intent:  This balances Flanking not requiring you to be directly opposite the other attacker._

## Conditions

**These rules are experimental and are subject to change based upon gameplay balance and experience.**

The following conditions apply **only to players** and replace other conditions found in the game.

_Intent:  Being completely unable to act is probably the least fun thing in the game.  These conditions still significantly impair/inhibit a player but do not remove all control of their character._

### Stunned becomes Staggered

When a creature is staggered:

* The creature has disadvantage on Attack rolls, as well as Strength and Dexterity checks and saves.
* The creature can not take reactions.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

### Paralyzed becomes Reeling

When a creature is reeling:

* The creature has disadvantage on Attack rolls
* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity checks and saves.
* The creature can not take bonus actions or reactions.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
* Any Attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.
* The creature's movement speed is halved.
