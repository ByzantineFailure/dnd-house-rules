## Flanking

We will play with a variant of the "Flanking" rule.  Generally speaking, anywhere "behind" a creature will suffice to flank it.
|EXAMPLE | GRID | HERE |
|-|-|-|
| EMPTY | ATTACKER | EMPTY |
| EMPTY | TARGET | EMPTY |
| FLANKS | FLANKS | FLANKS |

"Flanked" is a condition which gives all attacks on a creature advantage.
