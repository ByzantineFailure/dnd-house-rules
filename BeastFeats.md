# Beast Feats and Progression

Animal companions and familiars are a great part of DnD!  However, as characters level they tend to become more of a burden than a help.  The rules laid out here are intended to allow them to remain useful without becoming overpowered.

As a summary, beasts gain hit dice and feats as their owners level.  They inherit their owner's proficiency modifier.  

## Qualifying for these rules

In order to qualify for these rules a given beast must be persistent in the party and tied to the character's identity.  For example, a wizard's familiar, a ranger's wolf companion, or a knight's horse might qualify for these rules.  Creatures adopted by the party as the adventure progresses may also qualify for these rules at the DM's discretion.

## Hit Dice and Hit Points

**These rules are experimental and subject to tweaking if they are determined to significantly affect game balance.**

Animal companions and familiars gain hit dice as their owner levels.  **In order to retain game balance creatures with higher-value  hit dice gain extra at a slower rate than creatures with lower-value hit dice.  Creatures with low-value HD and high CON mods may disrupt balance and are subject to additional restrictions.**

Hit dice for animal companions is `HD Max + CON Mod` at level one and `ceil(HD Avg) + CON Mod` at higher levels.

| Hit Dice | ceil(HD Avg) | Gained every X owner levels |
|----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| d1       | 1 | 1 |
| d2       | 2 | 1 |
| d3       | 2 | 1 |
| d4       | 3 | 2 |
| d6       | 4 | 2 |
| d8       | 5 | 2 |
| d10      | 6 | 2 |
| d12      | 7 | 2 |

## Proficiency Modifier

Animal companions inherit their master's proficiency modifier.

## Beast Feats

Every two levels a beast companion may select one feat from the following table.  Players are encouraged to flavor their companion in a way that makes sense with feats they have selected.  For example, a fiendish familiar which has selected "Deterrent" could be flavored as gaining horns, glowing red eyes, and an odor of brimstone.
