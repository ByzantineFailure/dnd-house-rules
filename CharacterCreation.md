# Character Creation House Rules

* Standard Array for Stats:
  * [17, 15, 13, 13, 11, 9]
  * Intent:  Players should have one execellent stat, one good stat, and one weakness. Players should be powerful but not overly powerful.
* Gain an extra skill or tool proficiency per INT Modifier (+3 INT Mod gives 3 proficiencies).
  * Applies only on character creation
  * If taking a skill proficiency you MUST exhaust your class options for skills before taking others
  * Intent: INT is the stat that gives the least to characters.  Without something like this there is no motivation for players to not sacrifice it by default
* Start with a feat at level 1.
  * You may not take stats in lieu of a feat
  * You may not take the `Polearm Master` feat.  This feat breaks the balance of the game at level 1
  * Intent:  Feats are fun
* HP at levels 1-3 is `HD Max + CON Mod`.  HP at higher levels is `ceil(HD Avg) + CON Mod`
